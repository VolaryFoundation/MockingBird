MockingBird (Data Manipulation WebSite)
================

The server acts as a webpage for group and other feature's data storage. The system is a client of the Eagle server (https://github.com/VolaryFoundation/Eagle) 
You will need to hook up to a local eagle server to use this system. See read me on above repo link to help with setup.

Systems being used: Sinatra, SASS, MongoDB, HAML, Shotgun

Setup:
------
*Clone the code base from git hub*  
    `git clone git@github.com:VolaryFoundation/MockingBird-API.git`

*Copy and update database yml file if personal env is needed*  
    `cp env.rb env_personal.rb`

Access the page through the root.

*Code Standards:*  
* HAML on html
